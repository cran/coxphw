The R package **coxphw** implements weighted estimation in Cox regression as 
proposed by Schemper, Wakounig and Heinze (Statistics in Medicine, 2009, \doi{10.1002/sim.3623}) 
and as described in Dunkler, Ploner, Schemper and Heinze (Journal of Statistical Software, 2018, \doi{10.18637/jss.v084.i02}). 
The package provides options to estimate time-dependent effects conveniently by
including interactions of covariates with arbitrary functions of time, with or without
making use of the weighting option.
