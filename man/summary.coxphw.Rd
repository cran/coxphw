\title{ Summary Method for Objects of Class \code{coxphw} }

\description{ This class of objects is returned by the \code{coxphw} function. 
  Objects of this class have methods for the functions \code{summary}, \code{print}, \code{coef}, 
  \code{vcov}, and \code{confint}. }

\usage{ \method{summary}{coxphw}(object, print = TRUE, ...) }

\arguments{
  \item{object}{ object of class \code{coxphw}. }
  \item{print}{ print summary. Default is TRUE. }
  \item{\dots}{ further arguments. }
}

\details{ If \code{betafix} was requested for one or more regression coefficients, no estimates on inference
are given for these coefficients as they were not estimated in the model. The global Wald test 
only relates to those variables for whom regression coefficients were estimated.}
